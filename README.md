# linear_regression
Implementation of simple linear regression, a method for finding the best-fit line through a set of data points. This project was made for my introduction to computer programming.

VARIABLE DECLARATIONS: variables are used to store various values, including the number of data samples (n), the sums of x and y, the summation of XY, the summation of x^2, and the coefficients of the linear regression equation (a and b).

INPUT OF DATA: The user is prompted to enter the number of data points (n) and then the X and Y values for each data point.

CALCULATION OF SUMS: The program calculates the sum of X (x), sum of Y (y), summation of XY (sumXY), and summation of x^2 (squaredX) by iterating through the entered data points.

CALCULATION OF COEFFICIENTS (a AND b): The program calculates the slope (a) and y-intercept (b) using the formulas for simple linear regression.

This program takes user input for X and Y values, calculates the sums needed for linear regression, computes the slope and y-intercept, and then outputs the equation of the best-fit line for the given data.
